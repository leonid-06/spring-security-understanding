# spring-security-understanding

1) In this lesson we implemented basic project with authentication that comes out of the box Spring Security

We have controller `GET http://localhost:8080/hello` and `default configuration of Spring Security`

And now if we make simple `curl http://localhost:8080/hello` then will get 
`{
"status":401,
"error":"Unauthorized",
"message":"Unauthorized",
"path":"/hello"
}`

Therefore, we need to define basic auth credentials automatically generated by Spring `curl -u user:93a01cf0-794b-4b98-86ef-54860f36f7f3 http://localhost:8080/hello`

The response to the call is

`Hello!`

Also we can use more low level approach
`echo -n user:93a01cf0-794b-4b98-86ef-54860f36f7f3 | base64`
Get `dXNlcjo5M2EwMWNmMC03OTRiLTRiOTgtODZlZi01NDg2MGYzNmY3ZjM=`
`curl -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcjo5M2EwMWNmMC03OTRiLTRiOTgtODZlZi01NDg2MGYzNmY3ZjM="  localhost:8080/hello`

2) In this lesson we will slightly override `out of box logic` added custom UserDetailService implementation (InMemoryUserDetailsManager) and added custom PasswordEncoder implementation

We created user who has a set of credentials (username and password)

Added the user to be managed by our implementation of UserDetailsService

Define a bean of the type PasswordEncoder that our application can use to verify a given password with the one stored and managed by UserDetailsService

`curl -iu leo:pass http://localhost:8080/hello` 200 OK

3) In this part we will customize the handling of authentication and authorization, by defining a bean of type SecurityFilterChain

It makes sense, I can do it this way, but for some reason it doesn't work.

4) In this topic, Let's try to create custom AuthProvider (consist and manage user-details and pass-encoder)
